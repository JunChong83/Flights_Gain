# Analyzing Flight Gains at United Airlines: A Confidence Interval and Hypothesis Testing Approach

Introduction:
This report examines flight gains at United Airlines by utilizing confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, as well as exploratory data analysis. A new variable, net gain, is created to measure how much quicker the flight ended up being than planned.

Findings:
The analysis found that flights that departed late had a significantly higher average gain than those that departed on time, and flights that departed more than 30 minutes late had an even higher average gain. The five most common destination airports for United Airlines flights from New York City were Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Houston, and Denver. Los Angeles had the highest average gain, followed by San Francisco, Chicago, Houston, and Denver. The analysis also found that flights that departed more than 30 minutes late had a significantly higher average gain per hour than those that departed on time. However, there was no significant difference in average gain per hour between longer and shorter flights.

Conclusion:
The findings can be used to optimize flight scheduling and operational processes to improve gain per flight and customer satisfaction at United Airlines. For example, focusing on reducing departure delays, particularly those over 30 minutes, could lead to higher average gains per flight and improved efficiency. Additionally, considering the average gain and gain per hour for the top destination airports can inform decisions on route planning and resource allocation.
